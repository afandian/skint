<h3>
    Booking Process
</h3>
<p>
    Last year we tried a new booking process and seeing as how it worked so beautifully we're going to stick with it this year as well.  Those that sign up in the first half hour (7-7:30pm) will be jumbled up and allocated places in a randomised order (so that people with slower broadband don't miss out unfairly).  After 7:30pm places will be allocated in the traditional first-come-first-served basis.  You can apply for a single place or for two, so couples don't need to worry about only one of you getting a place.  
</p>
<p>
    During the booking process you will need the following information.
    <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Contact number</li>
    <li>Dietary requirements</li>
    <li>Where you will be travelling from (for potential lift-sharing)</li>
    <li>How you can help (first aid, workshops, playing for dancing, leading a meal, washing up, etc)</li>
    <li>Whether you intend to camp indoors or outdoors - it's the same price</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bookings are not transferrable</strong>
</p>

<p>
    It's likely that if you apply after 7:30pm you will end up on the waiting list, so be there or be square!

    Day &amp; evening places

    As well as weekend tickets we are also going to be offering day and evening places that don't include food or indoor camping.  These tickets will be available on the door.  Please email skint.dance@gmail.com if you are planning to camp outside!
