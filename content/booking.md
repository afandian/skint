<h1>Booking</h1>

<p class="lead">Booking will open on the 24th of August 2016 at 7pm UK BST time. <a href="/varaus" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">Click here to book tickets.</a></p>

<p>You will be able to apply for a weekend place or, if there are two of you, make a double application. You'll need to supply your name and email address, plus the name and email address of the other person you're applying for if you're making the double application. <strong>Applications are not transferrable</strong>.</p>

<p>Last year we sold out of weekend places in 30 seconds. This year we're trying something new to make it fairer on people with slower computers. There will be a 30 minute sign-up window, after which we're going to randomly shuffle all applications before assigning places, so you don't need to worry about being the first to click.</p>

<p>You will know by midnight if your application was successful. You'll then have a week to pay for your place.  If you don't pay then it will be offered to someone else.<p>

<h2>Details required</h2>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Contact number</li>
<li>Dietary requirements</li>
<li>Where you will be travelling from (for potential lift-sharing)</li>
<li>How you can help (first aid, workshops, playing for dancing, leading a meal, washing up, etc)</li>
<li>Whether you intend to camp indoors or outdoors - it's the same price</li>
</ul>

<h2>Waiting list</h2>
<p>We expect Skint to sell out very quickly again, but there is a waiting list and it's worth being on it!</p>
<p>If full places become available we will offer them to people on the waiting list in order.</p>

<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>Payment is via GoCardless. Please pay promptly. If this is a problem, you will need to contact us via email.</p>

<h2>Prices</h2>
<p>Full Weekend (includes participation in the group meals and indoor/outdoor camping) Friday evening to Sunday afternoon  &pound;35.</p>

**Booking for 2017 will open at 7pm 16th August.**

<h3>
    Booking Process
</h3>
<p>
    Last year we tried a new booking process and seeing as how it worked so beautifully we're going to stick with it this year as well.  Those that sign up in the first half hour (7-7:30pm) will be jumbled up and allocated places in a randomised order (so that people with slower broadband don't miss out unfairly).  After 7:30pm places will be allocated in the traditional first-come-first-served basis.  You can apply for a single place or for two, so couples don't need to worry about only one of you getting a place.
</p>
<p>
    It's likely that if you apply after 7:30pm you will end up on the waiting list, so be there or be square!
</p>

<h3>Day &amp; evening places</h3>
<p>
    As well as weekend tickets we are also going to be offering day and evening places that don't include food or indoor camping.  These tickets will be available on the door.  Please email skint.dance@gmail.com if you are planning to camp outside!
