<h1>Booking</h1>

<p class="lead">Booking will open on the 24th of August 2016 at 7pm UK BST time. <a href="/varaus" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">Click here to book tickets.</a></p>

<p>You will be able to apply for a weekend place or, if there are two of you, make a double application. You'll need to supply your name and email address, plus the name and email address of the other person you're applying for if you're making the double application. <strong>Applications are not transferrable</strong>.</p>

<p>Last year we sold out of weekend places in 30 seconds. This year we're trying something new to make it fairer on people with slower computers. There will be a 30 minute sign-up window, after which we're going to randomly shuffle all applications before assigning places, so you don't need to worry about being the first to click.</p>

<p>You will know by midnight if your application was successful. You'll then have a week to pay for your place.  If you don't pay then it will be offered to someone else.<p>

<h2>Details required</h2>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Contact number</li>
<li>Dietary requirements</li>
<li>Where you will be travelling from (for potential lift-sharing)</li>
<li>How you can help (first aid, workshops, playing for dancing, leading a meal, washing up, etc)</li>
<li>Whether you intend to camp indoors or outdoors - it's the same price</li>
</ul>

<h2>Waiting list</h2>
<p>We expect Skint to sell out very quickly again, but there is a waiting list and it's worth being on it!</p>
<p>If full places become available we will offer them to people on the waiting list in order.</p>

<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>Payment is via GoCardless. Please pay promptly. If this is a problem, you will need to contact us via email.</p>

<h2>Prices</h2>
<p>Full Weekend (includes participation in the group meals and indoor/outdoor camping) Friday evening to Sunday afternoon  &pound;35.</p>
