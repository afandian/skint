### Food

If you have booked meals then you will be included in the communally prepared meals.  All meals are vegetarian.  If you have any other dietary requirements / allergies then please let us know on the boking form, or drop us [an email at skint.dance@gmail.com](mailto:skint.dance@gmail.com)

Please bring your own drinks - water, juice, tea, and coffee will be provided.

If you have not booked for a meal, then you may bring your own food, but unfortunately there will be limited seating space and you will be unable to use the kitchen in the hall.  There are also 3 pubs in the village which serve fantastic food.

### Accommodation

#### Indoor camping

Sleeping bags and mattresses on the floor in the hall. You’ll need to bring a sleeping bag, mat, and pillow. As everyone is sleeping in close proximity and there may be music late into the night in adjoining rooms, we suggest that you bring earplugs!

#### Outdoor camping

If you prefer more space, not having to move your bed each morning and less snoring, there is a camping field very close to the hall.

Both indoor & outdoor camping can be booked on our booking page and costs £8 per person (this includes camping on both Friday & Saturday nights).

#### Local accommodation
There are also B&Bs and self-catering cottages nearby.

### Showers

We will have access to the showers in the Sports Pavilion next door at certain times during the weekend. The showers are coin-operated with 20p pieces. Please bring some with you!
